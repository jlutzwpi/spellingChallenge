# Spelling Challenge
Python spelling challenge game for kids using computer vision.

This was developed on a Jetson Nano. I started on the Raspberry Pi 4 (and ported over).
Requires OpenCV and Tensorflow.  I created the model using the KaggleAZ dataset and Google Colab.
My configuration is: 
1. Jetpack 4.6 
2. TensorRT 8.0
3. OpenCV 4.5.
4. CUDA 10.2.
